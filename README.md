_Warning_: You probably don't need this library. If you're looking for third-party React hooks, check out the [zustand](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zustand) library first!

reactmart is a simple global state management solution built using React hooks. It's meant to imitate the design of Vuex of the Vue ecosystem, keeping your state in a plain-old-javascript-object (POJO).

This package ships with only two exports:

|name	|export |description   	|
|---	|---	|---	|
|useStore   	|default   	|Custom hook that returns store object   	|
|StoreProvider  |named   	|Context wrapper component   	|

Each key/value in your store is returned by `useStore` with a `state` value and `set` method attached.

- `state` is the current value of the state key.

- `set` is a function that takes a new state value and updates the `state` value.

<br />

To use reactmart, first wrap the `StoreProvider` component at the root of your project, and pass it the initial state of each store variable in object notation:
```js
// App.js
import React from 'react'
import { StoreProvider } from 'reactmart'
import Children from './Children'

export const App = () => 
    <StoreProvider value={{
        foo: "bar",
        biz: "baz"
    }}>
        <Children />
    </StoreProvider>
```
Then, in any child of `StoreProvider`, call `useStore` to access the store. It's useful to destructure the result:
```js
// Child.js
import React from ' react'
import useStore from 'reactmart'

export const Child = () => {
    const { foo } = useStore()

    return (
        <>
            {/* Displays "bar" */}
            <h1>{foo.state}</h1>

            {/* Updates foo to "buz" */}
            <button 
                onClick={() => foo.set('buz')}
            >
                Click me
            </button>
        </>
    )
}
```
It can also be useful to seperate the store and provide its type throughout your app:
```js
// store.ts
import useStore from "reactmart"

export const store = {
    foo: "bar",
    biz: "baz"
}

export const useTypedStore = () => useStore<typeof store>()
```
